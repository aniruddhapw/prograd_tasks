        Hello, my name is Aniruddha, and I'm excited to be here today. I'm a
        skilled software developer with expertise in JavaScript and React. Over
        the years, I've honed my skills in these technologies and have become
        proficient in creating responsive and scalable web applications. In
        JavaScript, I have a strong understanding of object-oriented programming
        and functional programming concepts. I'm well-versed in using JavaScript
        to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) and have experience with a
        variety of JavaScript libraries and frameworks. In React, I've built
        multiple projects and have experience in creating dynamic user
        interfaces with reusable components. I understand the importance of
        state management, and I'm comfortable working with Redux or Context API.
        Overall, I'm a team player who is always eager to learn new things and
        I'm confident that my skills in JavaScript and React will allow me to
        contribute effectively to your team. Thank you for the opportunity to be
        here today
